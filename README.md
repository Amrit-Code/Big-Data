Coursework for Big Data Processing
This was my coursework assignment for big data processing. This was a module where I learned how to deal with large amounts of data. Moreover, how two use a cluster and Hadoop to deal with that data to extract some meaningful information. Thus all the files here are in python and the assignment is attached below. Thus you can understand what each file of code is supposed to do.
